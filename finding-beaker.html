        <section id="Getting the Call">
            <h2>Getting the Call</h2>
            <div class="story-text">You're at home with your mommy and daddy, watching Gumby, when the sorcerer phone rings. 
	"Hello, this is Benjamin," you say, picking up. A familiar deep voice replies: it's Batman. 
    "Benjamin," he says, "No time to talk. Beaker is missing from the Brooklyn Cat Café. I'm in Iran dealing with a terrorist threat to a nuclear power facility and can't get away. Can you investigate and see if you can find that rascally little cat?"
    "On it!" you reply. 
    //Wow,// you think. //If Batman himself is calling, it must be a big deal!//
    
    Do you:
    
    <br><button>Go get Mommy and Daddy </button><button data-target=' Let's Go!'>Go</button><br>
    or
    <br><button>Head to the Brooklyn Cat Café by yourself — there's no time to lose!</button><button data-target='Second Thoughts'>Go</button><br></div>
        </section>
        

        <section id="Let's Go!">
            <h2> Let's Go!</h2>
            <div class="story-text">You explain the Beaker situation to your mommy and daddy and they're all in to help. You gather your stuff and make a beeline for the Brooklyn Cat Café!

<br><button>Use magic to get there fast</button><button data-target='Portal Passage'>Go</button><br>
<br><button>Take the subway so you have time to think</button><button data-target='Subway Strategy'>Go</button><br>
</div>
        </section>
        

        <section id="Portal Passage">
            <h2>Portal Passage</h2>
            <div class="story-text">You look around carefully to make sure nobody's watching and then, muttering a spell under your breath, you draw a circle in the air with your magic wand. Instantly, a door appears and through it you can see the entrance to the Brooklyn Cat Café.

"Alright, here we go," your mommy says. 

And all three of you hop through the portal. 

Arriving in front of the Brooklyn Cat Café, you have two choices. You can: 

<br><button>Walk through the front door.</button><button data-target='Beaker's Gone!'>Go</button><br> or <br><button>Snoop around a little first.</button><button data-target='A clue!'>Go</button><br>
</div>
        </section>
        

        <section id="Subway Strategy">
            <h2>Subway Strategy</h2>
            <div class="story-text">On the subway, the three of you consider the possibilties. 

"He could just be hiding somewhere," says your daddy.

"Would they have called Batman if they really thought he was just hiding in the café?" says your mommy. 

"No," you say. "He's definitely missing. The question is whether he escaped or whether..."

"What?" says your daddy, looking worried.

"Whether he was catnapped," you say. "But let's not jump to conclusions. Here we are."

The subway doors open and you step out, thinking over the possibilities, none of which sounds too great.

Reaching the street, you have a choice. Do you:

<br><button>Go directly inside</button><button data-target='Beaker's Gone!'>Go</button><br> or <br><button>Snoop around a little first</button><button data-target='A clue!'>Go</button><br> 
</div>
        </section>
        

        <section id="Second Thoughts">
            <h2>Second Thoughts</h2>
            <div class="story-text">You step out the door, ready to head to the Brooklyn Cat Café, when you hear a voice from above: "Hey, Benjamin! Where you headed?" It's your daddy — he saw you leave and is a little worried about you going out alone.

"Sorry, Daddy, I got a little overexcited and wanted to leave right away. I'll come up and tell you all about it."
